Strategy Pattern in ASP.NET Core
 Using this pattern, developers can isolate the code, internal logic, 
and the dependencies of various algorithms from the rest of the 
application code which makes the code easy to maintain and easy to scale.
 This pattern also allows us to alter the behavior of the application at
runtime by switching from one algorithm to another algorithm.
